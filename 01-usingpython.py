# -*- Python Introduction -*- 
"""Python is a 
      * modern, robust, high level programming language
      * It is very easy to pick up even if you are completely new to programming.

#What is this environment?
#This is known as a "web-based interactive NOTEBOOK" environment 

#It is an interactive computational environment, in which you can 
#combine code execution, rich text, mathematics, plots 
#and rich media

#A notebook is a web application for interactive, reproducible, 
#exploratory data analysis
# They support REPL-style live coding in different languages, 
#such as Python, R, Scala, or SQL, with inline visualizations 
#and explanatory text. Advanced features may include collaboration,
#SCM integration, and security.



"""Before getting into “What is Python?”, the advantages of Python 
were once succinctly summarized by a UCAR scientist:

I have used a combination of Perl, Fortran, NCL, Matlab, R 
and others for routine research, but found out this 
general- purpose language, Python, can handle almost 
all in an efficient way from requesting data from 
remote online sites to statistics, and graphics."""





"""Example:
    Examples can be given using either the ``Example`` or ``Examples``
    sections. Sections support any reStructuredText formatting, including
    literal blocks::

        $ python example_google.py
        
Section breaks are created by resuming unindented text. Section breaks
are also implicitly created anytime a new section starts.

Attributes:
    module_level_variable1 (int): Module level variables may be documented in
        either the ``Attributes`` section of the module docstring, or in an
        inline docstring immediately following the variable.

        Either form is acceptable, but the two should not be mixed. Choose
        one convention to document module level variables and be consistent
        with it.

Todo:
    * For module TODOs
    * You have to also use ``sphinx.ext.todo`` extension
